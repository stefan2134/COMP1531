        Confirmations:
            A user can search for a health centre by suburb based on an inputted suburb name 
            All health care centres located in the inputted suburb are displayed.
            Brief details and the links are provided about the centre in the search results
    User story: as a patient, I want to search for a health care centre by name so I can find a specific centre

-- Summary of decisions made in stand-up meetings, requirements elicited and key design decisions --
Branches should not be named after people, must change it so that each branch is for a feature.
Everyone's user stories were analysed and the follow epic stories were agreed upon:
	Searching for health services
	Booking an appointment
Viewing profiles as an epic story is in dispute. To be decided during the next lab, on Friday 24th August
We will need to finalise the user stories and accompaning requirements next meeting
Next meeting: Thursday 23/08/2018 10am at Main Library Room 401

FINALISED USER STORIES:
EPIC: As a patient, I want to search for a healthcare service so that I can book an appointment
    FEATURE: search for a healthcare centre
        As a patient, I want to search for a healthcare centre by name so that I can be treated at my preferred centre
        As a patient, I want to search for a healthcare centre by suburb so that I can be treated at a centre near me
    FEATURE: search for a healthcare provider
        As a patient, I want to search for a healthcare provider by name so that I can be treated by my preferred provider
        As a patient, I want to search for a healthcare provider by service so that I can find the specific help I need

-- Responsibilities allocated to each team member and tasks to be accomplished for the next meeting --
Each of us will make a list of requirements necessary in the design.

-- Reflection on assigned tasks --
Stefan and Michelle did not brainstorm acceptance criteria as they felt it was more important to decide on the user stories first.

DATE OF MEETING: Monday 03/09/2018 11am-1pm
LOCATION: Main Library Room 415
ATTENDEES: Stefan Fan, Michelle Seeto, Frank Tran, Muhammad Al Waliy

-- Milestones Achieved --
User stories finalised, including story points

-- Summary of decisions made during meeting --
Refer to shopping system example for clarifications
The rating that users make are associated with a patient and a provider, instead of being related to a specific appointment
We will have a separate list for patients and providers instead of a general 'users' class
Use draw.io linked with github for velocity chart
To ascertain availability of appointment times, iterate through list of appointments to check if the time is free 

-- Tasks accomplished during meeting --
Handwritten class diagram completed

-- Obstacles Encountered --   (clarification in a lab 12-2 session same day by tutors)
Q: Does the health care centre have its own working hours? 
A: They have the same working hours
Q: Where are the provider working hours?
A: they have the same hours as the centre, just that they cant have an appointment at the same time
Q: Do centres have their own ID? 
A: Yes, known as their abn
Q: Why do the providers have 'cs1531' as their ID? 
A: It is a BUG
Q: Does it bring any value to have a list of users in general, or can we have a list of providers and a list of patient?
A: It is in our discretion
Q: Are ratings specific to appointments or are they an overall rating between a patient to a service? 
A: We can rate ANYONE, ANYTIME, even if no appointment with them, at least for the first iteration
Q: Is the relationship between provider and employment a composition or aggregation?
A: Aggregation (usually the case when a user is involved). Also, we usually 'pass' details in about a user

-- Next meeting's agenda --
Decide which user stories will need to be fulfilled in the next iteration
Partition user stories to be responsible to each member
Make a UML Class Diagram and see how our system will function
Next meeting location: 05/09/2018 Main Library Lvl 2 220b, 12pm

-- Reflection on assigned tasks --
The class diagram need to have appropritate managers, i.e. user manager
